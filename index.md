Welcome to Audio Computing Lab! We will be using GitHub Classroom to host our assignments and online discussions. You will receive an invitation to join the GitHub Classroom, which will give you access to all assignments during the semester. You will also receive an invitation to join the course’s GitHub organization page, which is where all online discussion will take place.

Lastly, lecture slides are available through modules on the Canvas page, along with the course syllabus and your lab grades. You really only need Canvas to check on grades and download lecture slides- everything else can be found through the GitHub organization and Classroom.

## Assignments

![](c.png)

To access assignments, visit GitHub Classroom and checkout the available labs. If you’ve worked with GitHub repos before and have a preferred IDE, working on labs will feel familiar. You will be provided your own repository of the lab, and your most recent push to this repository will be your “submission” for the lab. As for completing the labs, you will need a local installation of Python to properly run a number of the labs. 

**Important Note:** Do NOT make pull requests to your lab repositories! These requests will make your lab code visible to the entire class, and submitting public code to a lab is a FAIR violation.

## Grading

Grading is done manually by the course staff once a lab deadline has passed. We will evaluate your code and results for each question on a scale from 0-3 depending on whether or not you were able to complete the question. Once your lab has been graded, you will see a score added to your lab’s Jupyter notebook file, and the same score will also be added to Canvas in the Grades tab.

## Extensions

The course staff understands that surprises happen, and sometimes students need more time due to outstanding situations. While we don’t accept late submissions, if you feel like you are in need of an extension, don’t hesitate to reach out privately to course staff.

## Public Discussions

All public discussions will take place in our organization page under Discussions. This is also where we’ll post course announcements, so make sure to keep notifications on for these! 

Discussions can include $LaTeX$, pictures of plots, and audio to help clarify your thoughts. For audio, you will need to convert your files to .mov (add .mov to the end of your audio file) in order for playback to work.

## Private Discussions/Questions

We understand that students might have private questions that they don’t want shared with the rest of the class. Here’s how you can reach us about those:

* For lab-specific private questions, simply create an Issue under the Issues tab of your repo, and tag the course staff with @uiuc-cs448/staff, or individual members of staff by username (@psmaragdis, @ematth, @dbralios, @quinnouyang). 


* For more general questions, (course-related or something outside the scope of a lab or week’s content), add issues to your Lab 0 repository and tag course staff. If you forget and put these questions under a different lab, don’t worry! We’ll still be notified, but keeping these questions in your Lab 0 makes them easier to find later.

## Other Discussion Tidbits:

* Course staff will be staying up to date with GitHub discussions and will try to have your questions answered as soon as humanly possible.
* If you really have to reach out over email, please CC one of the TAs (Evan at evanmm3@illinois.edu, Dimitris at dbralios@illinois.edu)- we’ll try to get to your email as quickly as we can.
* If you specifically need to talk with Prof. Smaragdis, don’t hesitate to ask him before/after/during lecture or lab sessions.
