## Welcome

Welcome to the homepage of CS 448, the Audio Computing Lab, for Spring 2025!

We use GitHub (via GitHub Classroom) and Canvas.

- GitHub: assignments/labs, discussions, and everything else that isn't on Canvas. You need to accept an invitation link (via email or Canvas?) to have access.
- Canvas: syllabus, lecture slides, and grades. You should automatically have access after registering for the course.

# Assignments

> **⚠️ WARNING:** Do not make pull requests (PRs) in your assignment repos! These requests will make your code from an otherwise-private repo visible to the entire class and **submitting public code is a FAIR violation**. (It's a dumb GitHub bug, not a feature.)

### Access Repositories

Each assignment/lab comes as a repo that we release in sequence to you via a link that you need to accept. Accepting that link creates your own private fork of that repo. Only you and course staff can see and edit these.

### Deadlines

We release a lab approximately once per week which is then due about two weeks after that (check your repo for specific deadlines). You lose write access to a lab once the deadline arrives so make sure you commit and push everything by then!

### Grades

Course staff manually grades each lab after the deadline. We evaluate your code and results for each question on a `0-3` scale depending on how much you completed the question. Once we grade your lab, you should see a grade and some comments that we committed to your notebook and that same grade on Canvas.

### Extensions

We do not grade late work (in fact, [you literally cannot submit work after the deadline](https://uiuc-cs448.github.io/#Deadlines)). We only grade what you have committed and pushed by the deadline.

But we understand that surprises and circumstances happen, so if you believe you need of an extension, please ask course staff!

# GitHub Discussions

_GitHub Discussions page_

All course discussions/communications will take place in [our organization page under Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/uiuc-cs448/discussions). This includes course announcements so [keep your GitHub notifications on for this organization](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#about-custom-notifications)!

Discussions can include $LaTeX$, plots, and audio for exchanging help about labs, course content, etc. To attach audio files, change the extension to `.mov` before uploading. Otherwise, it won't play! (It's a dumb GitHub, not a feature.)

> **⚠️ WARNING:** Everything on the Discussions page is viewable to the entire course. Hence, do not post non-trivial code or ask about private/sensitive issues.

## Private Questions/Contact

If you have a private question or issue to notify course staff about (e.g. requesting an extension):

- For lab-specific questions, **create an Issue** under the Issues tab of your repo for that lab ([not a PR!](https://uiuc-cs448.github.io/#Assignments)) and **tag the course staff** with `@uiuc-cs448/staff` (or individual staff members by username {Instructor: `@psmaragdis`, TAs: `@ematth`, `@dbralios`, CA: `@quinnouyang`}).

- For more general/non-lab questions, create an Issue to your `Lab 0` repo and tag course staff. No biggie if you create an issue under the "wrong" lab, but keeping issues that aren't lab specific here helps keep us organized.

- Course staff prefers communicating over issues and should have a reasonable response time, but if email feels much more appropriate (e.g. for an urgent matter), please email the instructor (Prof. Smaragdis at `paris@illinois.edu`) and CC at least one of the TAs (Evan at `evanmm3@illinois.edu` or Dimitris at `dbralios@illinois.edu`).

- Or just ask us in-person for a private space to speak!
